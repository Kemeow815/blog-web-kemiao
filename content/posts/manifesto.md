# OpenTF Manifesto

OpenTF's goal is to ensure Terraform remains truly open source and proposes returning it to a fully open license. We urge HashiCorp to reconsider and switch Terraform back to an open source license, avoiding fragmentation of the community.

For further details and the full text of the manifesto, you can visit the [OpenTF website](https://opentf.org).
