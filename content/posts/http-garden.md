# The HTTP Garden
The HTTP Garden is a collection of HTTP servers and proxies configured to be composable, along with scripts to interact with them in a way that makes finding vulnerabilities much much easier. For some cool demos of the vulnerabilities that you can find with the HTTP Garden, check out [our ShmooCon 2024 talk](https://invidious.slipfox.xyz/watch?v=aKPAX00ft5s&t=2h19m0s).

## Acknowledgements

We'd like to thank our friends at [Galois](https://galois.com), [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), [Narf Industries](https://narfindustries.com/), and [Dartmouth College](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/) for making this project possible.

This material is based upon work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under contract number HR0011-19-C-0076.

## Getting Started

### Platform
The HTTP Garden runs on Linux, and is untested on other platforms. We make use of ASan, and due to [a bug in the way that ASan deals with ASLR](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1716#issuecomment-1902782650), you should either disable ASLR or [follow the advice here](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/1716#issuecomment-1902782650) before starting the Garden.


### Dependencies
1. The HTTP Garden uses Docker, so you're going to have to install Docker.
2. You'll also need the following Python packages, which you can get from PyPI (i.e. with `pip`) or from your system package manager:
- `docker`
  - For interacting with Docker
- `pyyaml`
  - For parsing yaml
- `tqdm`
  - For progress bars

If you're installing Python packages with your system package manager, be aware that the package names may need to be prefixed with `py3-`, `python3-`, or `python-`, depending on the system.

3. I also highly recommend installing [rlwrap](https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap) from your package manager, because it makes the Garden repl a lot more fun.

### Building
- Build the base image:
```sh
docker build ./images/http-garden-soil -t http-garden-soil
```
This image contains some basic utilities, plus a forked AFL++ that facilitates collecting coverage from processes without killing them.

- Build some HTTP servers and proxies:
```sh
docker compose build gunicorn hyper nginx haproxy nginx_proxy
```

There are, of course, way more targets in the HTTP garden than the ones we just built. It's just that building them all takes a long time. Even building these few will take a few minutes!
### Running
- Start up some servers and proxies:
```sh
docker compose up gunicorn hyper nginx haproxy nginx_proxy
```
- Start the repl:
```sh
rlwrap python3 tools/repl.py
```
- Filter a basic GET request through [HAProxy](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy), then through [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx) acting as a reverse proxy, then send the result to [Gunicorn](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn), [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/), and [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx), and display whether their interpretations match:
```
garden> payload 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: whatever\r\n\r\n' # Set the payload
garden> transduce haproxy nginx_proxy # Run the payload through HAProxy and Nginx
[1]: 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: whatever\r\n\r\n'
    ⬇️ haproxy
[2]: 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nhost: whatever\r\n\r\n'
    ⬇️ nginx_proxy
[3]: 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: echo\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n'
garden> servers gunicorn hyper nginx # Select the servers
garden> grid
         gunicorn hyper    nginx
gunicorn ✅       ✅       ✅
hyper    ✅       ✅       ✅
nginx    ✅       ✅       ✅
```
Seems like they all agree. Let's try a more interesting payload:
```
garden> payload 'POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: a\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n0\n\r\n'
garden> grid
         gunicorn hyper    nginx
gunicorn ✅       ✅       ❌
hyper    ✅       ✅       ❌
nginx    ❌       ❌       ✅
```
There's a discrepancy! This is because Nginx supports `\n` as a line ending in chunk lines, but Hyper and Gunicorn don't. Nginx is technically violating RFC 9112 here, but the impact is likely minimal.

## Directory Layout
### `images`
The `images` directory contains a subdirectory for each HTTP server and transducer in the Garden.
Each target gets its own Docker image. All programs are built from source inside Docker images based on Debian Bookworm when possible. So that we can easily build multiple versions of each target, nearly all targets have an `APP_VERSION` build argument which can usually be set to any tag, branch, or commit hash from the project's repository.

### `tools`
The `tools` directory contains the scripts that are used to interact with the servers.

### External Targets
If you have external services (probably CDNs or servers that you can't run in Docker) that you want to add to the Garden, we do support that. See the bottom of `external-services.yml` for some more details on that.

## Bugs
These are the bugs we've found using the HTTP Garden. If you find some of your own, please submit a PR to add them to this list!
Each bug is described with the following fields:
  - Use case: The type of attack an attacker can execute with this bug
  - Requirements: Required configuration options or other servers in order for this bug to be exploited.
  - Risk: None|Low|Medium|High, followed by a short explanation.
    - None: The bug is likely not exploitable.
    - Low: The bug might be exploitable, but it requires a really weird config or would rely on a proxy behaving in a way that I've never seen.
    - Medium: The bug is likely exploitable, but has only moderate impact or requires an unlikely server/transducer combination.
    - High: The bug is exploitable in common configurations and server/transducer combinations.
  - Payload: An example payload that triggers the bug
  - Affected programs: A list of servers in which this bug is present, along with report and patch timelines. Since some implementation bugs are common, and this keeps them from cluttering the list :)

### Server Bugs
These are bugs in the way servers accept and interpret requests.

1. The Python `int` constructor is used to parse chunk-sizes, so `0x`, `_`, `+`, and `-` are misinterpreted.
  - Use case: Request smuggling
  - Requirements: A transducer that interprets chunk-sizes as their longest valid prefix, but forwards them as-is.
  - Risk: Medium. See transducer bug 7.
  - Payload: `GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: a\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n0_2e\r\n\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: a\r\nContent-Length: 5\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n`

## Transducer Bugs
These are bugs in the way transducers interpret, normalize, and forward requests.

1. `0x`-prefixed `Content-Length` values are incorrectly accepted and forwarded, without validation of the message body.
  - Use case: Request smuggling
  - Requirements: A server that either interprets `Content-Length` as its longest valid prefix, or interprets `0x`-prefixed `Content-Length`.
  - Risk: Medium. See servers bugs 10, 29, and 32.
  - Payload: `POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: akamai.my-domain.cool\r\nContent-Length: 0x10\r\n\r\nZ`

      - January 31, 2024: Remains unfixed.
15. Requests containing both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers are forwarded as-is if the `Transfer-Encoding` value is unrecognized.
  - Use case: Request smuggling
  - Requirements: A backend server that treats `,chunked` as equivalent to `chunked`, and prioritizes `Transfer-Encoding` over `Content-Length`. These behaviors are allowed by the standards.
  - Risk: High. This allows request smuggling to standards-compliant servers.
  - Payload: `GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: whatever\r\nTransfer-Encoding: ,chunked\r\nContent-Length: 5\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n0r\n\r\n`

16. `\n` is not normalized to `\r\n` in forwarded messages.
  - Use case: Request smuggling
  - Requirements: A backend server that does not interpret `\n` as a line ending in header lines. The standard allows servers to translate `\n` to ` `.
  - Risk: High. This bug is exploitable against standards-compliant servers.
  - Payload: `GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: whatever\nConnection: close\n\n`
  - Affected programs:
    - OpenLiteSpeed:
      - November 3, 2023: Reported via email.

17. Chunked message bodies containing an extra `\r\n` before the terminator chunk are un-chunked without replacing the `Transfer-Encoding` header with `Content-Length`.
  - Use case: Request smuggling
  - Requirements: None.
  - Risk: High. This bug is exploitable against arbitrary backend servers.
  - Payload: `POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: a\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n17\r\n0\r\n\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n`

18. `Transfer-Encoding: ,chunked` headers are forwarded intact, and are not interpreted as equivalent to `chunked`.
  - Use case: Request smuggling
  - Requirements: A server that interprets `,chunked` as equivalent to `chunked`, which the standard says you MAY do.
  - Risk: High. This is a request smuggling vulnerability that is usable against standards-compliant backends.
  - Payload: `GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: whatever\r\nTransfer-Encoding: ,chunked\r\nContent-Length: 5\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n`

20. Headers containing `\x00` or `\n` are concatenated into the previous header's value.
  - Use case: Request smuggling
  - Requirements: Any standards-compliant backend server.
  - Risk: High. This is a generic request smuggling vulnerability.
  - Payload: `GET / HTTP/1.1\r\na:b\r\nc\x00\r\n\r\n`

  - Risk: Low. While this does crash ATS, it's so easy to notice that a reasonable person would not have deployed a vulnerable instance in production.
  - Payload: Any request at all.
  - Affected programs:
    - Apache Traffic Server:
      - July 31, 2023: Reported via [GH issue](https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/issues/10116).
      - September 13, 2023: Fixed via [PR](https://github.com/apache/trafficserver/pull/10399).
3. Sending an extra byte after a request with a chunked message body crashes the server with a segfault.
  - Use case: DoS
  - Requirements: FastCGI is enabled.
  - Risk: High. This is a trivial-to-exploit bug that crashes the server.
  - Payload: `GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: whatever\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n0\r\n\r\n\x00`
  - Affected programs:
    - OpenBSD httpd:
      - November 1, 2023: Reported via email.
      - November 8, 2023: Fixed in [commit](https://github.com/openbsd/src/commit/76ed904538b7966e735c4736a6e2cf7222ad67cf).
4. Incoming chunked request bodies are echoed back before the response is sent.
  - Use case: DoS
  - Requirements: FastCGI is enabled.
  - Risk: Medium. This will invalidate the request stream for any chunked message, which will ruin shared connections.
  - Payload: `POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: whatever\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n1\r\nZ\r\n0\r\n\rn\`
  - Affected programs:
    - OpenBSD httpd:
      - January 4, 2024: Reported via email.
      - January 31, 2024: Remains unfixed.
5. NULL dereference upon receipt of any request.
  - Use case: DoS
  - Requirements: `mod_dir` is enabled with certain configuration options.
  - Risk: Low. This bug is so obvious that no one sane would deploy a vulnerable server.
  - Payload: Anything at all.
  - Affected programs:
    - Apache httpd:
      - January 24, 2024: Reported via [Bugzilla issue](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=68527).
      - January 24, 2024: Remains unfixed.

## Bonus Bonus Bugs
These are bugs that we found back when the Garden had HTTP/2 support. We removed HTTP/2 support because it was a little half-baked, but would love to be able to add it back!
1. Whitespace characters are not stripped from field values during HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 downgrades.
  - Use case: ???
  - Requirements: N/A
  - Risk: None
  - Payload: `PRI * HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00E\x01\x05\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\n:authority\tlocalhost\x00\x05:path\x01/\x00\x07:method\x03GET\x00\x07:scheme\x04http\x00\x05test1\x03\ta\t`
  - Affected programs:
    - Envoy:
      - July 7, 2023: Reported via [GH issue](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28285).
      - October 7, 2023: Remains unfixed.
    - H2O:
      - July 7, 2023: Reported via [GH issue](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/3250).
      - July 18, 2023: Fixed in [PR #3256](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/3256).
    - Varnish Cache:
      - July 7, 2023: Reported via [GH issue](https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/issues/3952).
      - August 22, 2023: Fixed in [commit](https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/commit/6af7d972d30371154d9b86943258905e58748ce5).
2. Empty header names are preserved across HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1 translation, leading to the production of invalid HTTP/1.1.
  - Use case: DoS
  - Requirements: An HTTP/2 downgrade is being performed, and the backend rejects empty header names (as most do).
  - Risk: Low. This bug can be used to make a reasonable server 400, which will break connection sharing.
  - Payload: `PRI * HTTP/2.0\r\n\r\nSM\r\n\r\n\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00=\x01\x05\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\n:authority\tlocalhost\x00\x05:path\x01/\x00\x07:method\x03GET\x00\x07:scheme\x04http\x00\x00\x00`
  - Affected programs:
    - H2O:
      - July 7, 2023: Reported via [GH issue](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/issues/3250).
