## Building
```
git clone https://github.com/ianpatt/sfse
cmake -B sfse/build -S sfse
cmake --build sfse/build --config Release
```
## Runtime Support
SFSE supports the latest version of Starfield on Steam. The MS Store/Gamepass version is not supported. No, making it so you can see the files doesn't solve the problem.
