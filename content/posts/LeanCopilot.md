Lean Copilot: LLMs as Copilots for Theorem Proving in Lean
==========================================================

Lean Copilot allows large language models (LLMs) to be used in Lean for proof automation, e.g., suggesting tactics/premises and searching for proofs. You can use our built-in models from [LeanDojo](https://leandojo.org/) or bring your own models that run either locally (w/ or w/o GPUs) or on the cloud.

## Requirements

* Supported platforms: Linux, macOS and Windows WSL
* [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/)
* Optional (recommended if you have a [CUDA-enabled GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)): CUDA and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
* Required for building Lean Copilot itself (rather than a downstream package): CMake >= 3.7 and a C++17 compatible compiler

## Using Lean Copilot in Your Project

:warning: Your project must use a Lean version of at least `lean4:v4.3.0-rc2`.

### Adding Lean Copilot as a Dependency

1. Add the package configuration option `moreLinkArgs := #["-L./.lake/packages/LeanCopilot/.lake/build/lib", "-lctranslate2"]` to lakefile.lean. Also add the following line:
```lean
require LeanCopilot from git "https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanCopilot.git" @ "v1.0.0"
```
3. Run `lake update LeanCopilot`
4. Run `lake exe LeanCopilot/download` to download the built-in models from Hugging Face to `~/.cache/lean_copilot/`
5. Run `lake build`

[Here](https://github.com/yangky11/lean4-example/blob/LeanCopilot-demo) is an example of a Lean package depending on Lean Copilot. If you have problems building the project, our [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile), [build.sh](scripts/build.sh) or [build_example.sh](scripts/build_example.sh) may be helpful.


### Getting Started with Lean Copilot


#### Tactic Suggestion

After `import LeanCopilot`, you can use the tactic `suggest_tactics` to generate tactic suggestions. You can click on any of the suggested tactics to use it in the proof.

You can provide a prefix (e.g., `simp`) to constrain the generated tactics:

#### Proof Search

The tactic `search_proof` combines LLM-generated tactics with [aesop](https://github.com/leanprover-community/aesop) to search for multi-tactic proofs. When a proof is found, you can click on it to insert it into the editor. 

<img width="824" alt="search_proof" src="https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanCopilot/assets/5431913/0748b9b1-8eb0-4437-bcbf-12e4ea939943">



#### Premise Selection

The `select_premises` tactic retrieves a list of potentially useful premises. Currently, it uses the retriever in [LeanDojo](https://leandojo.org/) to select premises from a fixed snapshot of Lean and [mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/3ce43c18f614b76e161f911b75a3e1ef641620ff).

#### Running LLMs

You can also run the inference of any LLMs in Lean, which can be used to build customized proof automation or other LLM-based applications (not limited to theorem proving). It's possible to run arbitrary models either locally or remotely (see [Bring Your Own Model](#bring-your-own-model)).

## Advanced Usage

**This section is only for advanced users who would like to change the default behavior of `suggest_tactics`, `search_proof`, or `select_premises`, e.g., to use different models or hyperparameters.**

### Tactic APIs

* Examples in [TacticSuggestion.lean](LeanCopilotTests/TacticSuggestion.lean) showcase how to configure `suggest_tactics`, e.g., to use different models or generate different numbers of tactics.
* Examples in [ProofSearch.lean](LeanCopilotTests/ProofSearch.lean) showcase how to configure the proof search using options provided by [aesop](https://github.com/leanprover-community/aesop).
* Examples in [PremiseSelection.lean](LeanCopilotTests/PremiseSelection.lean) showcase how to set the number of retrieved premises for `select_premises`.




### Model APIs

**Examples in [ModelAPIs.lean](LeanCopilotTests/ModelAPIs.lean) showcase how to run the inference of different models and configure their parameters (temperature, beam size, etc.).** 

Lean Copilot supports two kinds of models: generators and encoders. Generators must implement the `TextToText` interface:
```lean
class TextToText (τ : Type) where
  generate (model : τ) (input : String) (targetPrefix : String) : IO $ Array (String × Float)
```
* `input` is the input string
* `targetPrefix` is used to constrain the generator's output. `""` means no constraint.
* `generate` should return an array of `String × Float`. Each `String` is an output from the model, and `Float` is the corresponding score.

We provide three types of Generators:
* [`NativeGenerator`](LeanCopilot/Models/Native.lean) runs locally powered by [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2) and is linked to Lean using Foreign Function Interface (FFI).
* [`ExternalGenerator`](LeanCopilot/Models/External.lean) is hosted either locally or remotely. See [Bring Your Own Model](#bring-your-own-model) for details.
* [`GenericGenerator`](LeanCopilot/Models/Generic.lean) can be anything that implements the `generate` function in the `TextToText` typeclass.


Encoders must implement `TextToVec`:
```lean
class TextToVec (τ : Type) where
  encode : τ → String → IO FloatArray
```
* `input` is the input string
* `encode` should return a vector embedding produced by the model.

Similar to generators, we have `NativeEncoder`, `ExternalEncoder`, and `GenericEncoder`.


### Bring Your Own Model

In principle, it is possible to run any model using Lean Copilot through `ExternalGenerator` or `ExternalEncoder` (examples in [ModelAPIs.lean](LeanCopilotTests/ModelAPIs.lean)). To use a model, you need to wrap it properly to expose the APIs in [external_model_api.yaml](./external_model_api.yaml). As an example, we provide a [Python API server](./python) and use it to run a few models, including [llmstep-mathlib4-pythia2.8b](https://huggingface.co/wellecks/llmstep-mathlib4-pythia2.8b).



## Caveats

* Lean may occasionally crash when restarting or editing a file. Restarting the file again should fix the problem.
* `select_premises` always retrieves the original form of a premise. For example, `Nat.add_left_comm` is a result of the theorem below. In this case, `select_premises` retrieves `Nat.mul_left_comm` instead of `Nat.add_left_comm`.
```lean
@[to_additive]
theorem mul_left_comm : ∀ a b c : G, a * (b * c) = b * (a * c)
```
* In some cases, `search_proof` produces an erroneous proof with error messages like `fail to show termination for ...`. A temporary workaround is changing the theorem's name before applying `search_proof`. You can change it back after `search_proof` completes.
