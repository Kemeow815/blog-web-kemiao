## Use your own reddit API credentials in Apollo


### Creating an API credential:

sign out of all accounts in Apollo before installing

1. Install the tweak and launch Apollo.
2. When prompted, sign into reddit.com.
3. After signing in, you'll be redirected to your account's "developer apps" page.
4. A new developer app needs to be created. The tweak will autopopulate all fields with the correct information.
5. Complete the Captcha and click `create app`.
6. Once the app has been created, you will land on the Apollo Home feed.
