# Noodle

> Noodle is an open source student productivity platform that helps students manage everything to do with their education from tasks, notes, flash cards to timetables. We are rethinking student productivity with Noodle.

![Noodle Preview](https://github.com/ixahmedxi/noodle/blob/main/apps/web/public/preview.png?raw=true)

**Noodle is still in early development and is not ready for use yet. Follow me on twitter [@ixahmedxii](https://twitter.com/ixahmedxii) for updates.**

## Purpose

Typically for a student, you need to be using multiple applications just to be managing your education well. This would include a note taking, calendar, task management, grade calculator, flash cards and more apps. This is tedious to manage and can be overwhelming for students.

Noodle is a platform that aims to solve this problem by providing a single platform for students to manage everything to do with their education. And with the power of having all of that data in one place, we can provide students with powerful insights and automation to help them be more productive.

With Noodle being open source, we hope to build a community of students and developers to help build the best student productivity platform.
