# Ransomchats
Here you'll find ransomware negotiations normalised as JSON files. 
Ransomware negotiations are usually not shared widely, limiting the understanding of the process. 
This project aims at changing that, in a respectful manner for the victims of cyberattacks: chats are anonymized as long as the victim hasn't been publicly disclosed, either by the attackers or in the media. 

You have copies of negotiations? 
You're more than welcome to contibute. 
You can find some parsers ready to use to help you with that. 

Thanks **[@thomfredev](https://twitter.com/thomfredev)** for the [reading app](https://github.com/thomfre/ransomchats-viewer) that's running here : **[ransomch.at](https://ransomch.at/)**
(thanks as well for the help getting it built properly)
