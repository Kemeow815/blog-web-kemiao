### What is Materials Discovery: GNoME?

From microchips to batteries and photovoltaics, discovery of inorganic crystals
is a fundamental problem in materials science. Graph Networks for Materials
Science (GNoME) is a project centered around scaling machine learning methods
to tackle this core task. With results recently published, this repository
serves to share the discovery of 381,000 novel stable materials with the wider
materials science community and hopefully enable exciting new research via the
updated convex hull.

This is a research project, not an official Google product. Expect bugs as the
repository expands and sharp edges. Please help by exploring the structures
and let us know what you think!

### Dataset

The dataset described in the original paper is provided across multiple file
formats. For more details, including how to download the dataset, please see
our dataset descriptor file in DATASET.md.

**Summarized** A summary of the dataset is provided in CSV format. This file
contains compositions and raw energies from Density Functional Theory (DFT)
calculations, as well as other popular measurements (e.g. formation energy and
decomposition energy).

**Structure** Loading of structures is slightly more cumbersome due to file
sizes involved. Due to the organization of the convex hull, only one structure
is needed per composition, so results from the summary can be used to pull
from the compressed data directory available in the linked Cloud Bucket.

**r²SCAN** Baseline calculations were performed via PBE functional for the
calculations. The paper also reports metrics for binaries and tenaries with
the r²SCAN functional. A summary of calculated energies and associated
metrics is included for these calculations.

### Models

We provide model definitions for the two sets of models used in the paper.

**GNoME** were the predominant model behind new materials
discovery. This simple message passing architecture was optimized by training
on a snapshot of Materials Project from 2018, leading to state-of-the-art results
of 21meV/atom.

**Nequip** corresponds to the architecture created by Batzner et al. (2022).
This architecture was used to train the interatomic potentials described in the
paper to learn the dynamics from the large dataset. We provide an implementation
in JAX as well as basic configuration parameters for the corresponding
architecture.

### Colabs

Colab examples of how to interact with the dataset and models will be released
to provide an easier interface with both.

### Upcoming

- [ ] Repeated calculations of structures from the Materials Project and other agglomerated datasets (Open Quantum Materials Database, WBM) under consistent settings (defining the complete convex hull)
- [ ] Example colabs of loading materials from the CSVs and calculating convex hull energies
- [ ] Code to visualize structures in a colab notebooks
- [ ] Reference structures and search paths
- [ ] Model training colabs and configs
- [ ] Additional material properties (e.g. electronic band structure)
