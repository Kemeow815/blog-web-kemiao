# SurfSense
While tools like NotebookLM and Perplexity are impressive and highly effective for conducting research on any topic/query, SurfSense elevates this capability by integrating with your personal knowledge base. It is a highly customizable AI research agent, connected to external sources such as search engines (Tavily, LinkUp), Slack, Linear, Notion, YouTube, GitHub and more to come.
