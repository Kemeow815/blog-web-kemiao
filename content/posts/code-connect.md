# Code Connect

Code Connect is a tool for connecting your design system components in code with your design system in Figma. When using Code Connect, Figma's Dev Mode will display true-to-production code snippets from your design system instead of autogenerated code examples. In addition to connecting component definitions, Code Connect also supports mapping properties from code to Figma enabling dynamic and correct examples. This can be useful for when you have an existing design system and are looking to drive consistent and correct adoption of that design system across design and engineering.

Code Connect is easy to set up, easy to maintain, type-safe, and extensible. Out of the box Code Connect comes with support for React, Storybook and SwiftUI.

> [!NOTE]
> Code Connect is available on Organization and Enterprise plans and requires a full Design or Dev Mode seat to use. Code Connect is currently in beta, so you can expect this feature to change. You may also experience bugs or performance issues during this time.
