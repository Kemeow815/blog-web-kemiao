# Dialoqbase ⚡

Dialoqbase is an open-source application designed to facilitate the creation of custom chatbots using a personalized knowledge base. The application leverages advanced language models to generate accurate and context-aware responses. Additionally, it utilizes PostgreSQL, a robust relational database management system, for efficient vector search operations and for storing the knowledge base.

Here's a demo of how it works (v0.0.1):

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the docker directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n4ze3m/dialoqbase.git
cd dialoqbase/docker
```

2. Edit the `.env` file and set the following environment variables:

- On Linux:

```bash
nano .env
```
or

```bash
vim .env
```

- On Windows:

```bash
notepad .env
```


Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable to your OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 
Set the `DB_SECRET_KEY` varible.

3. Run the docker-compose file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

or

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Log in using the default credentials:

```bash
username: admin
password: admin
```

_Important: After the first login, remember to change the default credentials._
