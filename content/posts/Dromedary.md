## Introduction

Dromedary is an open-source self-aligned language model trained with minimal human supervision.  For comprehensive details and insights, we kindly direct you to our [project page](https://github.com/IBM/Dromedary) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03047).

## Setup

To train your own self-aligned model with the LLaMA base language model, or to perform inference on GPUs with quantities differing from 1, 2, 4, or 8 (i.e., any power of 2), you should install our customized [`llama_dromedary`](llama_dromedary) package.

In a conda env with pytorch / cuda available, run:
```bash
cd llama_dromedary
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

Otherwise, if you only want to perform inference on 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 GPUs, you can reuse the original LLaMA repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama.git
cd llama
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

In addition, you should at least install the packages required for inference:
```bash
cd inference
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Weights

We release Dromedary weights as delta weights to comply with the LLaMA model license. You can add our delta to the original LLaMA weights to obtain the Dromedary weights. Instructions:

1. Get the original LLaMA weights in the Hugging Face format by following the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
2. Download the LoRA delta weights from our Hugging Face [model hub](https://huggingface.co/zhiqings/dromedary-65b-lora-delta-v0).
3. Follow our [inference guide](inference) to see how to deploy Dromedary/LLaMA on your own machine with [model parallel](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale/tree/main/fairscale/nn/model_parallel) (which should be significantly faster than Hugging Face's default pipeline parallel when using multiple GPUs).

## Inference

We provide a [chatbot demo](inference) for Dromedary.

## Training

We provide the full [training pipeline](training) of Dromedary for reproduction.

## Prompts

All the human annotations used in this project can be found [here](prompts).

### TODOs

- [ ] Add the requirements.txt for the training pipeline.
- [ ] Add the evaluation code for TruthfulQA and HHH Eval.
- [x] Release Dromedary delta weights at Hugging Face model hub.
- [ ] Add support for Hugging Face native pipeline in the released model hub.
- [ ] Release the synthetic training data of Dromedary.
- [x] Add support for stream inference in the chatbot demo.
- [ ] Fix the Hugging Face datasets/accelerate bug of fine-tuning in distributed setting.
