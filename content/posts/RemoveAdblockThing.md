## Introduction

This repository contains a userscript designed to remove the annoying "Ad blocker are not allowed on Youtube" popup. Follow the instructions below to get started.
We also have an undetected way of skipping ads if you get blocked from the video player.

## How to bypass the video player ban from using an ad blocker

1. **Install the script**:
   Install the script using the instructions above

   whitelist YouTube on any Chrome extensions that block ads or any third-party things that disable ads. Don't worry our script removes ads.
   (This only removes video player ads)
