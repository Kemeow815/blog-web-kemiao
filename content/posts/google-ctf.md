# Google CTF

This repository lists most of the challenges used in the Google CTF since 2017, as well as most of the infrastructure that can be used to run them. **IMPORTANT** - The code in the 201x and 202x folders have unfixed security vulnerabilities. These are there on purpose, and running these on real production infrastructure is not safe.

Note this is not an official Google product.
