## üí´ Redefining Your Relationship with Computers

Tired of working late nights on repetitive tasks? Frustrated by mundane activities consuming your creativity and precious time?

autoMate is not just another tool - it's your intelligent digital colleague for the AGI era, working tirelessly to help you restore balance between work and life.

**Let automation create more possibilities for your life.**

## üí° Project Overview
autoMate is a revolutionary AI+RPA automation tool built on OmniParser, turning AI into your "digital employee" that can:

When you first see autoMate automatically completing tasks that used to occupy hours of your time, you'll experience an indescribable sense of relief. This isn't just about efficiency - it's about liberating your creativity.

Imagine: waking up every morning to find that last night's data organization, report generation, and email responses have all been completed, leaving you only with work that truly requires your wisdom and creativity. This is the future autoMate brings to you.

## üìù FAQ

### üîß CUDA Version Mismatch
If you see the error: "GPU driver incompatible, please install appropriate torch version according to readme", it indicates a driver incompatibility. You can either:

1. Run with CPU only (slower but functional)
2. Check your torch version with `pip list`
3. Check supported CUDA versions on the [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
4. Reinstall Nvidia drivers
