## 📝 FAQ

### 🔧 CUDA Version Mismatch
We recommend using an NVIDIA graphics card with at least 4GB of VRAM, although you can also run it on CPU (which will be very slow):

1. Run `pip list` to check the torch version;
2. Check supported CUDA versions on the [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/);
3. Uninstall the currently installed torch and torchvision;
4. Copy the official torch installation command and reinstall torch for your CUDA version.

For example, if your CUDA version is 12.4, install torch using this command:

```bash
pip3 uninstall -y torch torchvision
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```
