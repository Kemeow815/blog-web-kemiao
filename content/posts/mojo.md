# Welcome to Mojo ðŸ”¥

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research 
and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems 
programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still young, but it is designed
to become a superset of Python over time.  

We plan to open-source Mojo progressively over time, but it's changing very quickly now. 
We believe that a small, tight-knit group of engineers with a shared vision can move 
faster than a community effort, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until 
it's more complete.  Please see the [Mojo FAQ](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/faq.html)
for more information about this and other common questions. 

We've opened this repo now because we want to gather issues and engage in feedback 
from users who have access to the Mojo Playground (our hosted JupyterHub
where you can try coding with an early version of Mojo). 
To get access to the Mojo Playground, [see here to sign up](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/get-started.html).
Then, when you want to report issues or request features,
[please create a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues).

For more general questions or to chat with other Mojo developers,
check out our [Discord](https://discord.gg/modular). 

Otherwise, you can:
- Read the [inspiration behind Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/why-mojo.html).
- Check out the [Mojo programming manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/programming-manual.html).
- Read our other docs on [docs.modular.com/mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo).
