This is the Twitter Open Source website at https://opensource.twitter.dev.

This site is built with [hugo], using a custom built-in theme.  Follow the
standard instructions on the hugo website to [install] and [run] hugo.  Just
make sure to use hugo-extended, which has added support for Sass/SCSS
stylesheets.

There are also some python scripts that run periodically to [update some repo
data].

[install]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/
[run]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/
[update some repo data]: ./.github/workflows/update-data.yml
