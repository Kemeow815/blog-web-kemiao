# LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of LLaMA ðŸš€

Official implementation of ['LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16199).

This repo proposes **LLaMA-Adapter**, a lightweight adaption method for fine-tuning instruction-following [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) models ðŸ”¥, using 52K data provided by [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca).



## Overview
Efficiency Comparison:
|  Model | Parameters | Storage Space | Training Time  
| :-----: | :-----: |:-----:| :-----: |
|  [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) | 7B |13G| 3 Hours|
|  LLaMA-Adapter | 1.2M |4.7M| 1 Hour|

By inserting adapters into LLaMA's transformer, our method only introduces **1.2M** learnable parameters, and turns a LLaMA into an instruction-following model within **1 hour**. For stablizing training at early stages, we propose a novel **Zero-init Attention** with zero gating mechanism to adaptively incorporate the instructional signals. After fine-tuning, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality instruction-following sentences, comparable to the fully fine-tuned [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) and [Alpaca-Lora](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora).

<div align="center">
  <img src="pipeline.png"/>

Our approach can be simply extended to **Multi-modal Input Instructions**. The reasoning framework of image-conditioned LLaMA-Adapter for [ScienceQA](https://scienceqa.github.io/) is as follows, which is also shared by other modalities, such as audio and video.

## News
* **TODO**: training code, multi-modal LLaMA-Adapter, adapters for larger-scale LLaMA models
* [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16199.pdf) is available on arXiv ðŸ“Œ. 
* The generation code of LLaMA-Adapter based on 7B LLaMA has been released.
* ðŸ”¥ We are **hiring** interns, postdocs and full-time researchers in **General Vision Group, Shanghai AI Lab**, aiming at multi-modality and vision foundation models. If you are interested, please contact gaopeng@pjlab.org.cn.


## Setup

Here is a from-scratch script.
```bash
conda create -n llama_adapter -y
conda activate llama_adapter

# install pytorch
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit -c pytorch -y

# install dependency and llama-adapter
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Inference

Please request access to the pre-trained LLaMA from [this form](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5) (official) or download the LLaMA-7B from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/nyanko7/LLaMA-7B/tree/main) (unofficial). Then, obtain the weights of our LLaMA-Adapter from [here](https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/LLaMA-Adapter/releases/download/v.1.0.0/llama_adapter_len10_layer30_release.pth). We denote the path to the downloaded weights of LLaMA and adapters as `TARGET_FOLDER` and `ADAPTER_PATH`.

Here is an example to generate instruction-following sentences with 7B LLaMA model and our LLaMA-Adapter:
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example.py \
         --ckpt_dir $TARGET_FOLDER/model_size\
         --tokenizer_path $TARGET_FOLDER/tokenizer.model \
         --adapter_path $ADAPTER_PATH
```

## Training

We will release the training code soon. We use 52K instruction-following [data](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/blob/main/alpaca_data.json) from [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) for training, and adopt the hyper-parameters as following:

| hyper-parameter | value |
|-----------------|-------|
| batch Size      | 64    |
| learning rate   | 9e-3  |
| warmup epochs   | 2     |
| epochs          | 5     |
| weight decay    | 0.02  |


## Comparison with Other Methods

They are kept mainly for their fine, soft fleece, which is used to make knitwear and other garments. Alpacas are herd animals and live in small family groups, led by an older male. They are highly social animals and can form strong bonds with their owners.

* **text-davinci-003**: Alpacas are a domesticated species of South American camelid, similar to llamas. They are native to the Andes Mountains in South America and are kept as livestock for their soft, luxurious wool. Alpacas are social animals and live in herds of up to 20 individuals. They are typically kept in small herds of two to five animals, and are relatively easy to care for. Alpacas are herbivores and feed on grass, hay, and other vegetation. They are also known for their gentle and friendly nature, making them popular as pets.

Looking for someone to make me feel at peace.

I'm a lonely soul who's searching for a love,
Looking for someone to make me feel alive.

I'm a lonely soul who's searching for a friend,
Looking for someone to make me feel complete.

I'm a lonely soul who's searching for a dream,
Looking for someone to make me feel free.

I'm a lonely soul who's searching for a life,
Looking for someone to make me feel alive.

### Instruction 5: 
  Explain why this poem is good.

**Input**: Life, thin and light-off time and time again. Frivolous tireless. I heard the echo, from the valleys and the heart. Open to the lonely soul of sickle harvesting. Repeat outrightly, but also repeat the well-being of eventually swaying in the desert oasis. I believe I am. Born as the bright summer flowers.

* **LLaMA-Adapter**: This poem is good because it uses simple language to convey a powerful message. It explores the themes of loneliness and isolation, and captures the feelings of alienation and despair that many people experience. The poem also uses imagery to create a vivid picture of the emotions being described.
