# EasyLM
Large language models (LLMs) made easy, EasyLM is a one stop solution for
pre-training, finetuning, evaluating and serving LLMs in JAX/Flax. EasyLM can
scale up LLM training to hundreds of TPU/GPU accelerators by leveraging
JAX's pjit functionality.


Building on top of Hugginface's [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/index)
and [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index), this repo provides
an easy to use and easy to customize codebase for training large langauge models
without the complexity in many other frameworks.


EasyLM is built with JAX/Flax. By leveraging JAX's pjit utility, EasyLM is able
to train large model that doesn't fit on a single accelerator by sharding
the model weights and training data across multiple accelerators. Currently,
EasyLM supports multiple TPU/GPU training in a single host as well as multi-host
training on Google Cloud TPU Pods.

Currently, the following models are supported:
* [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)
* [GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B)
* [OPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01068)
* [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta)


## Koala
Koala is our new chatbot fine-tuned on top of LLaMA. If you are interested in our Koala chatbot, you can check out the [blogpost](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2023/04/03/koala/)
and [documentation for running it locally](docs/koala.md).


## Installation
The installation method differs between GPU hosts and Cloud TPU hosts. The first
step is to pull from GitHub.

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/young-geng/EasyLM.git
cd EasyLM
export PYTHONPATH="${PWD}:$PYTHONPATH"
```

#### Installing on GPU Host
The GPU environment can be installed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

``` shell
conda env create -f scripts/gpu_environment.yml
conda activate EasyLM
```

#### Installing on Cloud TPU Host
The TPU host VM comes with Python and PIP pre-installed. Simply run the following
script to set up the TPU host.

``` shell
./scripts/tpu_vm_setup.sh
```


## [Documentations](docs/README.md)
The EasyLM documentations can be found in the [docs](docs/) directory.
