# Llama2 Embeddings FastAPI Service

## Introduction

The Llama2 Embedding Server is designed to facilitate and optimize the process of obtaining text embeddings using different LLMs via llama_cpp and langchain. To avoid wasting computation, these embeddings are cached in SQlite and retrieved if they have already been computed before. To speed up the process of loading multiple LLMs, optional RAM Disks can be used, and the process for creating and managing them is handled automatically for you. 

Some additional useful endpoints are provided, such as computing semantic similarity between submitted text strings (using various measures of similarity, such as cosine similarity, but also more esoteric measures like [Hoeffding's D](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2021/05/03/examples-hoeffding-d.html) and [HSIC](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705121008297), and semantic search across all your cached embeddings using FAISS vector searching. 

You can also submit a plaintext file or PDF file (not requiring OCR) and get back a zip file containing all of the embeddings for each sentence as JSON, organized in various ways such `records`, `table`, etc. (i.e., all the export options from the Pandas `to_json()` function). The results of getting the embeddings for all sentences in a document can be returned either as a zip file containing a JSON file (so it won't crash Swagger among other things), or as a direct JSON response if you're using curl or similar.

In addition to fixed-sized embedding vectors, we also expose functionality that allows you to get back token-level embeddings, where each token in the input stream is embedded with its context in the string as a full sized vector, thus producing a matrix that has a number of rows equal to the number of tokens in the input string. This includes far more nuanced information about the contents of the string at the expense of much greater compute and storage requirements. The other drawback is that, instead of having the same sized output for every string, regardless of length (which makes it very easy to compare unequal length strings using cosine similarity and other measures), the token-level embedding matrix obviously differs in dimensions for two different strings if the strings have different numbers of tokens. To deal with this, we introduce combined feature vectors, which compute the column-wise mean, min, max, and std. deviation of the token-level emeddding matrix, and concatenate these together in to a single huge matrix; this allows you to compare strings of different lengths while still capturing more nuance. The combined results, including the embedding matrix and associated combined feature vector, can similarly be returned as either a zip file or direct JSON response.

*TLDR:* If you just want to try it very quickly on a fresh Ubuntu 22+ machine (warning, this will install docker using apt):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llama_embeddings_fastapi_service
cd llama_embeddings_fastapi_service
chmod +x setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
sudo ./setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
```

Then open a browser to `<your_static_ip_address>:8089` if you're using a VPS.

Or to `localhost:8089` if you're using your own machine-- but, really, you should never run untrusted code with sudo on your own machine! Just get a cheap VPS to experiment with for $30/month.

Watch the the automated setup process in action [here](https://asciinema.org/a/601603).

## Setup and Configuration

### RAM Disk Configuration

To enable password-less sudo for RAM Disk setup and teardown, edit the `sudoers` file with `sudo visudo`. Add the following lines, replacing `username` with your actual username:

```plaintext
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/mount -t tmpfs -o size=*G tmpfs /mnt/ramdisk
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/umount /mnt/ramdisk
```

The application provides functionalities to set up, clear, and manage RAM Disk. RAM Disk is used to store models in memory for faster access. It calculates the available RAM and sets up the RAM Disk accordingly. The functions `setup_ramdisk`, `copy_models_to_ramdisk`, and `clear_ramdisk` manage these tasks.

To run it natively (not using Docker) in a Python venv, you can use these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llama_embeddings_fastapi_service
cd llama_embeddings_fastapi_service
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 llama_2_embeddings_fastapi_server.py
```
Then access the FastAPI Swagger page at `http://localhost:8089`.

## Exception Handling

The application has robust exception handling to deal with various types of errors, including database errors and general exceptions. Custom exception handlers are defined for `SQLAlchemyError` and general `Exception`.

## Logging

Logging is configured at the INFO level to provide detailed logs for debugging and monitoring. The logger provides information about the state of the application, errors, and activities.

The logs are stored in a file named `llama2_embeddings_fastapi_service.log`, and a log rotation mechanism is implemented to handle log file backups. The rotating file handler is configured with a maximum file size of 10 MB, and it keeps up to 5 backup files.

When a log file reaches its maximum size, it is moved to the `old_logs` directory, and a new log file is created. The log entries are also printed to the standard output stream.

Here are some details of the logging configuration:
- Log Level: INFO
- Log Format: `%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s`
- Max Log File Size: 10 MB
- Backup Count: 5
- Old Logs Directory: `old_logs`

Additionally, the log level for SQLAlchemy's engine is set to WARNING to suppress verbose database logs.

## Performance Optimizations

This section highlights the major performance enhancements integrated into the provided code to ensure swift responses and optimal resource management.

### 1. **Asynchronous Programming**:
- **Benefit**: Handles multiple tasks concurrently, enhancing efficiency for I/O-bound operations like database transactions and network requests.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes Python's `asyncio` library for asynchronous database operations.

### 2. **Database Optimizations**:
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Mode**: Enables concurrent reads and writes, optimizing for applications with frequent write demands.
- **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**: Manages locked databases by retrying operations with progressive waiting times.
- **Batch Writes**: Aggregates write operations for more efficient database interactions.
- **DB Write Queue**: Uses an asynchronous queue to serialize write operations, ensuring consistent and non-conflicting database writes.

### 3. **RAM Disk Utilization**:
- **Benefit**: Speeds up I/O-bound tasks by prioritizing operations in RAM over disk.
- **Implementation**: Detects and prioritizes a RAM disk (`/mnt/ramdisk`) if available, otherwise defaults to the standard file system.

### 4. **Model Caching**:
- **Benefit**: Reduces overhead by keeping loaded models in memory for subsequent requests.
- **Implementation**: Uses a global `model_cache` dictionary to store and retrieve models.

### 5. **Parallel Inference**:
- **Benefit**: Enhances processing speed for multiple data units, like document sentences.
- **Implementation**: Employs `asyncio.gather` for concurrent inferences, regulated by a semaphore (`MAX_CONCURRENT_PARALLEL_INFERENCE_TASKS`).

### 6. **Embedding Caching**:
- **Benefit**: Once embeddings are computed for a particular text, they are stored in the database, eliminating the need for re-computation during subsequent requests.
- **Implementation**: When a request is made to compute an embedding, the system first checks the database. If the embedding for the given text is found, it is returned immediately, ensuring faster response times.

### Dockerized Llama2 Embeddings API Service App

A bash script is included in this repo, `setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh`, that will automatically do everything for you, including installing docker with apt install. 

To use it, first make the script executable and then run it like this:

```bash
chmod +x setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
sudo ./setup_dockerized_app_on_fresh_machine.sh
```

If you prefer a manual setup, then read the following instructions:

#### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Docker installed on your system. If not, follow these steps to install Docker on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo docker --version
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

You may need to log out and log back in or restart your system to apply the new group permissions, or use sudo in the following steps to build and run the container.

#### Setup and Running the Application

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Clone the Llama2 Embeddings API Service repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llama_embeddings_fastapi_service
   cd llama_embeddings_fastapi_service
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

   Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   sudo docker build -t llama-embeddings .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**

   Run the Docker container, mapping the container's port 8089 to the host's port 8089:

   ```bash
   sudo docker run -p 8089:8089 llama-embeddings
   ```

4. **Accessing the Application:**

   The FastAPI application will now be accessible at `http://localhost:8089` or at the static IP address of your VPS instance if you're running on one (You can get a 10-core, 30gb RAM, 1tb SSD with a static IP running Ubuntu 22.04 at Contabo for around $30/month, which is the cheapest I've found so far).

   You can interact then with the API using tools like `curl` or by accessing the FastAPI documentation at `http://localhost:8089/docs`.

6. **Viewing Logs:**

   Logs from the application can be viewed directly in the terminal where you ran the `docker run` command.

#### Stopping and Managing the Container

- To stop the running container, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or find the container ID using `docker ps` and run `sudo docker stop <container_id>`.
- To remove the built image, use `sudo docker rmi llama-embeddings`.

Based on the provided code, I'll help you update the `Startup Procedures` section of your `readme.md` file. Here's the updated version:

---

## Startup Procedures

During startup, the application performs the following tasks:

1. **Database Initialization**: 
    - The application initializes the SQLite database, setting up tables and executing important PRAGMAs to optimize performance. 
    - Some of the important SQLite PRAGMAs include setting the database to use Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode, setting synchronous mode to NORMAL, increasing cache size to 1GB, setting the busy timeout to 2 seconds, and setting the WAL autocheckpoint to 100.
2. **Initialize Database Writer**:
    - A dedicated database writer (`DatabaseWriter`) is initialized with a dedicated asynchronous queue to handle the write operations.
    - A set of hashes is created which represents the operations that are currently being processed or have already been processed. This avoids any duplicate operations in the queue.
3. **RAM Disk Setup**:
    - If the `USE_RAMDISK` variable is enabled and the user has the required permissions, the application sets up a RAM Disk.
    - The application checks if there's already a RAM Disk set up at the specified path, if not, it calculates the optimal size for the RAM Disk and sets it up.
    - If the RAM Disk is enabled but the user lacks the required permissions, the RAM Disk feature is disabled and the application proceeds without it.
4. **Model Downloads**: 
    - The application downloads the required models.
5. **Model Loading**:
    - Each downloaded model is loaded into memory. If any model file is not found, an error log is recorded.
6. **Build FAISS Indexes**: 
    - The application creates FAISS indexes for efficient similarity search using the embeddings from the database.
    - Separate FAISS indexes are built for token-level embeddings.
    - Associated texts are stored by model name for further use.

Note: 
- If the RAM Disk feature is enabled but the user lacks the required permissions, the application will disable the RAM Disk feature and proceed without it.
- For any database operations, if the database is locked, the application will attempt to retry the operation a few times with an exponential backoff and a jitter.
