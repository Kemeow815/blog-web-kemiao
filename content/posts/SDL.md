# Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) Version 3.0

https://www.libsdl.org/

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed
to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games
including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games.

More extensive documentation is available in the docs directory, starting
with [README.md](docs/README.md). If you are migrating to SDL 3.0 from SDL 2.0,
the changes are extensively documented in [README-migration.md](docs/README-migration.md).

Enjoy!
