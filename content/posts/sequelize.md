# Sequelize

Hello! We have changed the name of our main branch from `master` to `main`.

You're looking at the `master` branch right now, but you should see the main branch instead: https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize

Please open an issue if you have found any link in any of our docs that still point to the `master` branch instead.

Thank you!
