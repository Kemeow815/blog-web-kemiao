PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

## Installation

We distribute a [PHP Archive (PHAR)](https://php.net/phar) that has all required (as well as some optional) dependencies of PHPUnit bundled in a single file:

```bash
$ wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-X.Y.phar

$ php phpunit-X.Y.phar --version
```

Please replace `X.Y` with the version of PHPUnit you are interested in.

Alternatively, you may use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to download and install PHPUnit as well as its dependencies. Please refer to the "[Getting Started](https://phpunit.de/getting-started-with-phpunit.html)" guide for details on how to install PHPUnit.
