## 🔔News
✨[2024-02-26]: We have open-sourced the [OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-1.3b](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/OpenCodeInterpreter-DS-1.3B) Model.

📘[2024-02-26]: We have open-sourced the [CodeFeedback-Filtered-Instruction](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/CodeFeedback-Filtered-Instruction) Dataset.

🚀[2024-02-23]: We have open-sourced the datasets used in our project named [Code-Feedback](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/Code-Feedback).

🔥[2024-02-19]: We have open-sourced all models in the OpenCodeInterpreter series ! We welcome everyone to try out our models and look forward to your participation! 😆



## Introduction
OpenCodeInterpreter is a suite of open-source code generation systems aimed at bridging the gap between large language models and sophisticated proprietary systems like the GPT-4 Code Interpreter. It significantly enhances code generation capabilities by integrating execution and iterative refinement functionalities.

## Models
All models within the OpenCodeInterpreter series have been open-sourced on Hugging Face. You can access our models via the following link: [OpenCodeInterpreter Models](https://huggingface.co/collections/m-a-p/opencodeinterpreter-65d312f6f88da990a64da456).

## Data Collection
Supported by Code-Feedback, a dataset featuring 68K multi-turn interactions, OpenCodeInterpreter incorporates execution and human feedback for dynamic code refinement. 
For additional insights into data collection procedures, please consult the readme provided under [Data Collection](https://github.com/OpenCodeInterpreter/OpenCodeInterpreter/blob/main/data_collection/README.md).

## Evaluation
Our evaluation framework primarily utilizes HumanEval and MBP, alongside their extended versions, HumanEval+ and MBPP+, leveraging the [EvalPlus framework](https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus) for a more comprehensive assessment.
For specific evaluation methodologies, please refer to the [Evaluation README](https://github.com/OpenCodeInterpreter/OpenCodeInterpreter/blob/main/evaluation/README.md) for more details.
