RAGxplorer is an interactive streamlit tool to support the building of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications by visualizing document chunks and the queries in the embedding space. 

> [!NOTE]
> This app was for a [Streamlit competition](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/streamlit_ragxplorer-explore-the-embeddings-of-activity-7154217315566321664-6-d6), and was very scrapily put together one evening.
>
> I am re-factoring the code to be a package. You can view the progress in the `experiment` branch. Installation and usage details can be found [here](#using-the-experimental-version).
>
> Until then, I appreciate your patience, and suggestions will be most welcomed [here](https://github.com/gabrielchua/RAGxplorer/issues/3).

## Demo üîé
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://rag-xplorer.streamlit.app/)

‚ö†Ô∏è _Due to [infra limitations](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/is-there-streamlit-app-limitations-such-as-usage-time-users-etc/42800), this freely hosted demo may occasionally go down. The best experience is to clone this repo, and run it locally._

## Features ‚ú®

- **Document Upload**: Users can upload PDF documents.
- **Chunk Configuration**: Options to configure the chunk size and overlap
- **Choice of embedding model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or `text-embedding-ada-002`
- **Vector Database Creation**: Builds a vector database using Chroma
- **Query Expansion**: Generates sub-questions and hypothetical answers to enhance the retrieval process.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Utilizes Plotly to visualise the chunks.

## Local Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

To run RAGxplorer, ensure you have Python installed, and then install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-local-deployment.txt
```

> [!TIP]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use `requirements.txt`. That is so the free streamlit deployment can run. That file includes an additional `pysqlite3-binary` dependency.
> 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If it helps with troubleshooting, this application was built using Python 3.11

## Usage üèéÔ∏è

1. Setup `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required) and `ANYSCALE_API_KEY` (if you need anyscale). Copy
    the `.streamlit/secrets.example.toml` file to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and fill in the values.
2. To start the application, run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3. You may need to comment out/remove line 5-7 in `app.py`. 
    ```python
    __import__('pysqlite3')
    import sys
    sys.modules['sqlite3'] = sys.modules.pop('pysqlite3')
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> This repo is currently linked to the streamlit demo, and these lines were added due to the runtime in the free streamlit deployment env. See [here](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/issues-with-chroma-and-sqlite/47950).

## Using the experimental version üß™

### Installation
Enter the following in your terminal
```bash
git clone -b experiment https://github.com/gabrielchua/RAGxplorer.git
cd RAGxplorer
virtualenv venv # create a new virtual env
source venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation
Usage 
```python
from ragxplorer.ragxplorer import Explorer
client = Explorer(embedding_model="text-embedding-ada-002") # Please ensure "OPENAI_API_KEY" is set as an env variable
client.load_document("presentation.pdf")
client.visualise_query("What are the top revenue drivers for Microsoft?")
```
