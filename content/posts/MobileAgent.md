## üìãIntroduction
![](assets/example.png?v=1&type=image)
* Pure visual solution, independent of XML and system metadata.
* Unrestricted operation scope, capable of multi-app operations.
* Multiple visual perception tools for operation localization.
* No need for exploration and training, plug and play.

## üì¢News
*  [2.2] üî•We are deploying the demo based on Gradio and users will be able to upload the screenshots.
* [1.31] üî•Our code is available! Welcome to try Mobile-Agent.
* [1.31] üî•Human-operated data in Mobile-Eval is in preparation and will be open-sourced soon.
* [1.30] Our paper is available at [LINK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16158).
* [1.30] Our evaluation results on Mobile-Eval are available.
* [1.30] The code and Mobile-Eval benchmark are coming soon!

## üì∫Demo
https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent/assets/127390760/26c48fb0-67ed-4df6-97b2-aa0c18386d31

## üîßGetting Started
‚ùóSince the GPT-4V will have severe hallucinations when perceiving non-English screenshots, we strongly recommend using Mobile-Agent under English-only systems and apps to ensure the performance.

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.git
cd MobileAgent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Preparation for Connecting Mobile Device
1. Download the [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools?hl=en).
2. Turn on the ADB debugging switch on your Android phone, it needs to be turned on in the developer options first.
3. Connect your phone to the computer with a data cable and select "Transfer files".
4. Test your ADB environment as follow: ```/path/to/adb devices```. If the connected devices are displayed, the preparation is complete.
5. If you are using a MAC or Linux system, make sure to turn on adb permissions as follow: ```sudo chmod +x /path/to/adb```
6. If you are using Windows system, the path will be ```xx/xx/adb.exe```

### Preparation for Visual Perception Tools
1. Download the icon detection model [Grounding DION](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth)
2. The text detection model will be automatically downloaded from modelscope after you run Mobile-Agent.

### Run
```
python run.py --grounding_ckpt /path/to/GroundingDION --adb_path /path/to/adb --api "your API_TOKEN" --instruction "your instruction"
```

## üì±Mobile-Eval
Mobile-Eval is a benchmark designed for evaluating the performance of mobile device agents. This benchmark includes 10 mainstream single-app scenarios and 1 multi-app scenario. 

For each scenario, we have designed three instructions:
* Instruction 1: relatively simple and basic task
* Instruction 2: additional requirements added on top of the difficulty of Instruction 1
* Instruction 3: user demands with no explicit task indication

The detailed content of Mobile-Eval is as follows:
| Application   | Instruction   |
|-------|-------|
| Alibaba.com   | 1. Help me find caps in Alibaba.com.<br>2. Help me find caps in Alibaba.com. If the "Add to cart" is available in the item information page, please add the item to my cart.<br>3. I want to buy a cap. I've heard things are cheap on Alibaba.com. Maybe you can find it for me. |
| Amazon Music   | 1. Search singer Jay Chou in Amazon Music.<br>2. Search a music about "agent" in Amazon Music and play it.<br>3. I want to listen music to relax. Find an App to help me. |
| Chrome   | 1. Search result for today's Lakers game.<br>2. Search the information about Taylor Swift.<br>3. I want to know the result for today's Lakers game. Find an App to help me. |
| Gmail   | 1. Send an empty email to to {address}.<br>2. Send an email to {address}n to tell my new work.<br>3. I want to let my friend know my new work, and his address is {address}. Find an App to help me. |
| Google Maps   | 1. Navigate to Hangzhou West Lake.<br>2. Navigate to a nearby gas station.<br>3. I want to go to Hangzhou West Lake, but I don't know the way. Find an App to help me. |
| Google Play   | 1. Download WhatsApp in Play Store.<br>2. Download Instagram in Play Store.<br>3. I want WhatsApp on my phone. Find an App to help me. |
| Notes   | 1. Create a new note in Notes.<br>2. Create a new note in Notes and write "Hello, this is a note", then save it.<br>3. I suddenly have something to record, so help me find an App and write down the following content: meeting at 3pm. |
| Settings   | 1. Turn on the dark mode.<br>2. Turn on the airplane mode.<br>3. I want to see the real time internet speed at the battery level, please turn on this setting for me. |
| TikTok   | 1. Swipe a video about pet cat in TikTok and click a "like" for this video.<br>2. Swipe a video about pet cat in TikTok and comment "Ohhhh, so cute cat!".<br>3. Swipe videos in TikTok. Click "like" for 3 pet video cat. |
| YouTube  | 1. Search for videos about Stephen Curry on YouTube.<br>2. Search for videos about Stephen Curry on YouTube and open "Comments" to comment "Oh, chef, your basketball spirit has always inspired me".<br>3. I need you to help me show my love for Stephen Curry on YouTube. |
| Multi-App  | 1. Open the calendar and look at today's date, then go to Notes and create a new note to write "Today is {today's data}".<br>2. Check the temperature in the next 5 days, and then create a new note in Notes and write a temperature analysis.<br>3. Search the result for today's Lakers game, and then create a note in Notes to write a sport news for this result. |

## üìùEvaluation results
We evaluated Mobile-Agent on Mobile-Eval. The evaluation results are available at [LINK](https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent/tree/main/results).
*   We have stored the evaluation results for the 10 apps and the multi-app scenario in folders named after each app.
* The numbers within each app's folder represent the results for different types of instruction within that app.
*   For example, if you want to view the results of Mobile-Agent for the second instruction in Google Maps, you should go to the following path:```results/Google Maps/2```.
* If the last action of Mobile-Agent is not "stop", it indicates that Mobile-Agent did not complete the corresponding instruction. During the evaluation, we manually terminated these cases where completion was not possible.

## üìÑTo-do List
* Development of Mobile-Agent app on Android platform.
* Adaptation to other mobile device platforms.
