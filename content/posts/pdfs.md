# [tpn/pdfs](https://github.com/tpn/pdfs)

A veritable mish-mash of technically-oriented PDFs I've collected over the
years.  All content copyright the respective author(s).

(Note: I make a concerted effort to not publish anything here if the copyright
does not permit it.  If I've missed something, submit a pull request with the
offending document removed.)

For a much easier way to at least browse all of the PDFs in this repository
sans truncation, visit [https://github.dev/tpn/pdfs](https://github.dev/tpn/pdfs).
(Unfortunately, PDFs don't actually render in that view, but at least you can
easy see them all in one piece.)

You can also view the JSON export via: [https://api.github.com/repos/tpn/pdfs/git/trees/HEAD](https://api.github.com/repos/tpn/pdfs/git/trees/HEAD)
