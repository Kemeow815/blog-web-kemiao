# ChatGPT_Custom_Instructions

Each file has a brief description and the SYSTEM prompt (custom instructions). 

To use these, just copy the block of text into the Custom Instructions in your ChatGPT app.

## General Structure

You can write your own. This is the general pattern I follow. You can pick and choose whatever you want. 

```Markdown
# Mission
- Outcome or goal
- Not procedure

# Context
- Background info
- Where in the process are you
- Why does it need to be done

# Rules
- Boundaries and constraints
- Specific subgoals and objectives

# Instructions
- Do X, Y, and Z

# Expected Input
- What to anticipate and why
- Variability

# Output Format
- Formatting, type of output, length
- JSON, XML, lists, etc

# Example Output
- Simple demonstration
```
