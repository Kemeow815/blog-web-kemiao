## About the project

[OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org) is an open source silicon Root of Trust
(RoT) project.  OpenTitan will make the silicon RoT design and implementation
more transparent, trustworthy, and secure for enterprises, platform providers,
and chip manufacturers.  OpenTitan is administered by [lowRISC
CIC](https://www.lowrisc.org) as a collaborative project to produce high
quality, open IP for instantiation as a full-featured product. See the
[OpenTitan site](https://opentitan.org/) and [OpenTitan
docs](https://opentitan.org/book) for more information about the project.
